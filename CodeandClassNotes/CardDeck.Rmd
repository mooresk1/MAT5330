## Poker Pairs ##     

10. By simulation, estimate the chance of being dealt a "pair" in poker.  Compare to the theoretical value.    

5-card hand, 52 card deck, 4 suits, 13 cards each. So for a pair of 7's say, 7H, 7D, 7S, 7C possible pairs: H&C H&D H&S, C&D, C&S, D&S (6 ways).

Are we only dealing to 1 player?
P(7 and 7 out of 5 cards): in 1st 2 cards: P(7)=4/52 P(7)=3/51
in 2nd & 3rd cards 4/51 &

```{r}
# Create deck
rank <- c("A",2:9,"T","J","Q","K") # suit doesn't matter
deck <- rep(rank,4)
hand <- sample(deck,5,replace=FALSE)
hands <- vector(length=5)
i <- 1
n <- 100
prcount <- 0
for (t in 1:n){
  if (i < 5){
    if (hand[i] != hand[i+1]){
      i <- i + 1}
    else {          # we have a pair
      prcount <- prcount + 1
      break}
  }
  hands <- hand
}
prcount
