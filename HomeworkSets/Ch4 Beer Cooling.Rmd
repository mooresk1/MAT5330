Room Temp = 70F
Beer Init = 70F
Tap Water = 58F (like a cave should be close to avg temp over the year at that location)
Beer in fridge after 10 min = 65F
Fridge = 50F
12 12oz CANS as follows:  3 Imperial Stouts, 6 Scotch Ales, 3 IPA
How long until the beer reaches 50F?

F=1.8C + 32

dT/dt = k (Temp of surr - Temp of obj)

In our case, dT/dt = k (50-beer) or dT/(beer-50) = -k dt
Integrating both sides you get: beer - 50 = ce^(-kt)
Plugging in the initial temp of the beer and t=0, you get c=20 so
T(t) = 50 + 20e^(-kt)

After 10 minutes the beer is 65F, so
65 = 50 + 20e^(-10k) or k = (ln (3/4))/-10 = .02877

Thus for the beer to reach 52 degrees
52 = 50 + 20e^(-.02877t), t = 80 minutes and for 51 degrees it goes up to 104 minutes!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
t <- 10 # time
tobj <- 65  #init temp of beer
tsurr <- 50 # temp of fridge
troom <- 70
k <- 1/20
# integrate from time 0 to 10 to find k
f<-function(x){
  -1*k*(tobj-tsurr)
}
f(t)
integrate(f,0,t)
tfinal <- tsurr + ((tobj - tsurr)*exp(-k*t))
tfinal
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
