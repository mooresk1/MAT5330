## Poker Pairs ##     

10. By simulation, estimate the chance of being dealt a "pair" in poker.  Compare to the theoretical value.    

5-card hand, 52 card deck, 4 suits, 13 cards each. So for a pair of 7's say, 7H, 7D, 7S, 7C possible pairs: H&C H&D H&S, C&D, C&S, D&S (6 ways).

**Per http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~ramsey/Probability/PokerHands.html, the theoretical probability of getting a single pair is .422569**


```{r}
# Create deck
deck <- c(1:52) #1-13, 14-26, 27-39, 40-52 mod by 13
paircount <-0
n <- 1000
for (t in 1:n){
  # n = number of trials
  hand <- sample(deck,5,replace=FALSE)
  for (i in 1:5){
    hand[i] <- hand[i] %% 13}
  if (sum(duplicated(hand)) == 1){
    paircount <- paircount + 1}
}
pofpair <- mean(paircount)/n
pofpair
```
