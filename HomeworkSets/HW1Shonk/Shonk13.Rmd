13. An early detection test for HIV is 98% accurate.  In a certain community, 3% of the population has HIV.  What is the probability that a random person with a positive test for HIV actually has the disease?  Simulate this by selecting a person at random from the population and deciding whether or not the person has HIV.  Then administer the test and determine whether is was positive.  Keep a counter for the times that the test is positive and the times the test is positive AND the person has HIV.
