1. Perform a large number of trials of Buffon's needle problem and estimate the value of pi.  Plot the error as a function of the number of trials.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
# generate x and theta randomly
# set d and L # let L = 1 and d = 2
# find out how many times
# this is how they solved the atom bomb calculations - with Monte Carlo simulations
d <- 2    # distance between boards
L <- 1    # length of needle
n <- 100000   # number of needles
m <- 10000      # number of trials
pie <- numeric(m) # allocate space 
for (i in 1:m){
  theta <- (pi/2)*runif(n)  # drop them at random angles
  x <- (d/2)*runif(n)       # in random spots on the board
  hits <- (x<L/2*sin(theta))   # count how many cross the line (<= won't matter in real life)
  perc <- sum(hits)/n
  pie[i] <- 1/perc
}
hist(pie)
summary(pie)
# no need for loop, runif does it as one long vector

```
