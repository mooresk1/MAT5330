8. Use a biased coin to simulate a random walk of 30 steps on a line.  If the coin falls heads (H), take one step to the right, if it falls tails (T), take one step left.  Use Pr(H)=0.6 and Pr(T)=0.4. 

    a) Plot a sample path
    b) Make a histogram for 200 such random walks
    c) Report the sample mean of the 200 walks
    d) Report the sample variance of the 200 walks
    e) compare the mean and variance to their theoretical values
