This is an improved version of the "Food for Thought" problem in Chapter 6 of our textbook.

I am planning to write code so that a user can input the # of items to be scheduled (not necessarily food items) and what items need to be done in what order as well as the length of time each item requires.   

```{r}
n <- 0 # number of items
itemnum <- c(1:n) # items will be numbered in order they appear in "items"
items <- c("names of items")
dependencies <- c(0,0) # replace with #s of items this one depends on
iteminfo <- data.frame(itemnum,items,dependencies) # all need to be equal length
names(iteminfo) <- c("Item#","Item","Dependencies","Time Needed") # variable names 
```
