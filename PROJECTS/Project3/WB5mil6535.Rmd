**This version of the program is going to focus on retesting the Red/Yellow splits of 60/40, 65/35, and 70/30 for an initial $5K investment with a higher number of trials. It will also change to a 50/50 Yellow/Green split once the goal is hit. I will test for $3 million and $5 million goals, but in separate runs.**
