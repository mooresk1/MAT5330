## Warren Buffett Move Over    


                     My Scenario                         
 1. I will roll one number to apply to all risk categories.    
 2. My thinking is that either it's a good year for all or it's not.    
 3. I want to have at least 5 million in 20 years for retirement.   
 4. I will start with $5000 due to my age.    
 5. I want to find the combo that minimizes my chance of earning   
 less than 1 million while maximizing my chance of earning     
 at least 5 million
